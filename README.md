# Dashboard Assignment

A pixel-perfect implementation of the provided Figma design using React and Material UI with Tailwind CSS.

## Technical Choices

While the assignment suggested using Shadcn/Tailwind CSS, I opted for Material UI with Tailwind CSS for the following reasons:

1. _Component Rich Library_: Material UI provides a comprehensive set of pre-built components that closely match the Figma design requirements
2. _Seamless Integration_: Material UI works well with Tailwind CSS for custom styling
3. _Better Documentation_: Extensive documentation and community support
4. _Production Ready_: Material UI components are thoroughly tested and production-ready

## Tech Stack

- React.js
- Material UI
- MUI X Charts (for data visualization)
- Tailwind CSS

## Features

- Responsive design matching Figma specifications
- Interactive data table with sorting functionality
